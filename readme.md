BGRLL
-----

GUI for GRBL powered g-code interpreters.

Requires Nana GUI https://github.com/cnjinhao/nana  
and SFML https://github.com/SFML/SFML  

if using a compiler which doesn't support codecvt then
bgrll also requires boost to be installed.

Requires at least C++11 if not C++14 compiler support  

Developed mainly on Windows with VS2015 but also tested  
occasionally on linux using CMake / make. Might even  
work on OSX with some effort.
